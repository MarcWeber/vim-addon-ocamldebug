minimal rdebug debugging support based on vim-addon-async

usage:
  AsyncRubyRDebug ruby file.rb
  
  You can pass input to debug process, see documentation of vim-addon-async

What to expect?
if you hit a line
  require "debug"

You can use F5,6 ... to control the debugger and vim will open the
file and line where debugger stopped execution.

BUGS:
no threading support
no var support yet
