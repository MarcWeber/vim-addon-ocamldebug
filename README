minimal rdebug debugging support based on vim-addon-async

usage:
  add require 'debug' to your ruby project, then run:
  AsyncRubyRDebug ruby file.rb

  Then you can use F4,F5, ... to step and set breakpoints
  (see plugin/vim-addon-rdebug.vim)

  You can pass input to debug process, see documentation of vim-addon-async

BUGS:
no threading support yet
no support for debugging vars, but expecting vars by runing rdebug commands
works

support for multiple processes is started but not complete
